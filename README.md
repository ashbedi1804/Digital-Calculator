## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashbedi1804/Digital-Calculator.git
   cd Digital-Calculator
   ```

2. **Open in browser**  
   Launch `index.html` in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

3. **Use the calculator**  
   - Click numbers and operators to perform calculations.
   - Click **C** to clear display.

## 👩‍💻 Usage

- Point-and-click interface—no keyboard needed.
- JavaScript captures button clicks and builds a computation string.
- On hitting `=`, the expression is evaluated and result displayed.
- Errors (e.g. division by zero) show a browser alert message.

---

## 🔧 Customization & Development

- Modify **css/styles.css** to change layout, fonts, colors.
- Edit **js/script.js** to extend:
  - Add more operations (e.g. percentage, square root)
  - Enhance input handling and error checking
- Create themes, support mobile viewports, or keyboard input.

---

## 🧪 Testing

This is a basic client-side tool—no automated tests included by default. You can test manually by:
- Entering sequences like `12 + 34`, `56 ÷ 7`, etc.
- Trying edge cases such as `0 ÷ 0`, or long number input.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add support for keyboard input.
- Include scientific functions (sin, cos, sqrt).
- Store history of calculations.
- Mobile-first design enhancements.
